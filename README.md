# sofi-3d

Similar to [sofi-pixi](https://github.com/hey-sofia/sofi-pixi) this project serves as my playground for exploring concepts like graphics rendering and animation, except now it's **3D**! 🫨

Made possible by [three.js](https://threejs.org).

This project will also incorporate what I've learnt in [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com) to render 2D graphics alongside the 3D stuff (e.g. UI elements, sprites etc.)

You can see it live at [3d.sofia.bio](https://3d.sofia.bio)!
